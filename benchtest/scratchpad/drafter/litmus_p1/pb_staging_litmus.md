# Litmus: automated safety and security testing for government AI systems


Litmus is a testing-as-a-service platform for AI safety and security testing, run by GovTech as part of [AI Guardian](https://www.aiguardian.gov.sg). It sends curated adversarial prompts at your AI system, scores the responses, and returns a report, either on demand through a web application or automatically from a CI/CD pipeline.

## When to use it

Manual safety testing does not scale with a system that changes frequently. You can hand-write adversarial prompts, read the responses, and write up findings before a launch, but rarely on every deployment. Testing then becomes a gate you pass once rather than a measurement you track, and a prompt change three months later goes out with no safety signal attached to it.

Litmus automates that loop. The same curated suites run on a schedule or on each commit, results are scored without a person reading every response, and successive runs accumulate into a trend you can compare rather than a series of disconnected reports.

Use it when your system is already built and needs recurring safety and security testing against a standard suite. It does not evaluate whether your system does its job well. For that, see [functional evals](../evaluating-ai-systems/functional.mdx) and [Kaleidoscope](kaleidoscope.md), which is the contextual evaluation module within Litmus.

## How it works

The following diagram shows how Litmus enhances the safety and security of an AI system with automated testing via CI/CD integration:

You register your application endpoint and select the suites to run. Litmus dispatches hundreds of curated prompts at that endpoint, collects the responses, scores them automatically, and generates a report. You can trigger the same run manually from the web application, on a schedule, or from a CI/CD job on each commit or deployment, with the report saved back to the pipeline.

## What it covers

<div class="table-centered">

| Capability | What it means in practice |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline safety and security suites | A sanctioned standard set of tests, shared across agencies |
| Automated execution | Scheduled runs, parallel execution, and generated reports |
| CI/CD integration | Tests triggered on commit or deployment, with reports written back to the pipeline |
| API access | Programmatic runs and result retrieval, if you are integrating with your own systems |
| Custom scenarios | Application-specific test cases alongside the baseline suites |
| Trend comparison | Results compared across runs rather than read in isolation |

</div>

Litmus runs as multi-tenant software-as-a-service built to government security standards, so onboarding does not require your agency to host or maintain testing infrastructure.

## Where it fits alongside other tools

Litmus tests a system; it does not defend one at runtime. A failing Litmus result tells you that a category of prompt gets through, but the fix is a change to your system, such as a guardrail, a prompt change, or a permission change. [Sentinel](sentinel.md) provides the runtime input and output guardrails that implement those defences. The two are designed to be used together: Litmus identifies which risks your system actually exhibits, and Sentinel mitigates them in production.

## Pitfalls

- **Treating a passing run as coverage.** The baseline suites test common, known risks. They are a floor rather than a description of everything your system can get wrong, and application-specific risks need custom scenarios.
- **Running it only before launch.** A single pre-launch run gives you no trend, which is most of the value.
- **Testing an endpoint that is not the production path.** Results describe whatever endpoint you registered. If guardrails sit in front of your production endpoint but not the tested one, the scores describe a system nobody uses.
- **Reading refusal rates without context.** A system that refuses every request may score well on refusal-based safety tests while failing usefulness and false-refusal criteria. It is important to read the safety scores results alongside [functional evals](../evaluating-ai-systems/functional.mdx).

## Onboarding

Litmus is available to public sector teams through [AI Guardian](https://www.aiguardian.gov.sg), which carries the current onboarding guide. The web application is at [litmus.aiguardian.gov.sg](https://litmus.aiguardian.gov.sg/login) and signs in with TechPass. For questions about access, contact [aiguardian@tech.gov.sg](mailto:aiguardian@tech.gov.sg).
